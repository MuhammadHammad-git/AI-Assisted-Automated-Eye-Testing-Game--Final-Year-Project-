# AI Assisted Automated Eye Testing Game (Final Year Project) "SNELL"
## It is a completely Automated Eye Testing Machine. It is a game. It uses Voice Recognition AI! It is fun, interactive and addicting to play.
This is my most innovative and fun work. A project that encompasses all of my work and showcases my coding skills!
